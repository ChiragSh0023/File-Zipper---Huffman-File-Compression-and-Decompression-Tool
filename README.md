The "Huffman File Compression and Decompression Tool" is a software application that utilizes Huffman coding to efficiently compress files while preserving their original content. It constructs a Huffman tree based on character frequency, assigns shorter binary codes to frequent characters, and saves the compressed data with the Huffman treeâ€™s metadata. During decompression, it reconstructs the Huffman tree, decodes the compressed data, and restores the original file, making it a versatile and effective tool for data storage and transmission
